# AICollaboratory

This project is conceived as a pioneering initiative for the development of a collaboratory for the analysis, evaluation, comparison and classification of  AI paradigms and systems. It will start by incorporating approaches, data, knowledge, measurements and evaluations, within the machine learning, (deep) reinforcement learning and interactive learning paradigms in the field of A(G)I, due to the priorities and particular needs in these areas. The framework will allow the study, analysis and evaluation, in a complete and unified way, of a representative selection of these sort of A(G)I systems, covering, in the longer term, the current and future panorama of the A(G)I. 

# Infraestructure

This repository comprise an:

* **Inventory of intelligent systems**,  which incorporates information on current, past and future AI systems.

* **Repository of experimentation**, recording the results thereof for various tests and benchmarks.

Extra Info:

3 evaluation methodologies:

* **40/40**: Ponder off, General book (up to 12 moves), 3-4-5 piece EGTB. Time control: Equivalent to 40 moves in 40 minutes on Athlon 64 X2 4600+ (2.4 GHz), about 15 minutes on a modern Intel CPU.
* **40/4**: Ponder off, General book (up to 12 moves), 3-4-5 piece EGTB. Time control: Equivalent to 40 moves in 4 minutes on Athlon 64 X2 4600+ (2.4 GHz), about 1.5 minutes on a modern Intel CPU.
* **404FRC**: Shredder GUI, ChessGUI by Matthias Gemuh, Ponder off, 5-men EGTB, 128MB hash, random openings with switched sides. Time control: Equivalent to 40 moves in 4 minutes on Athlon 64 X2 4600+ (2.4 GHz), about 1.5 minutes on a modern Intel CPU.
